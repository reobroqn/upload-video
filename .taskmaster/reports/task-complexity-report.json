			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Configure environment variables' step into subtasks: setting up .env file, loading variables in FastAPI, and validating the loaded variables.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up a new project and installing dependencies, which is relatively straightforward. However, configuring environment variables can be tricky and warrants breaking down."

			"taskTitle": "Frontend Setup with Svelte and Tailwind CSS",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Create a basic layout' step into subtasks: setting up the navigation bar, creating a main content area, adding a footer, and implementing basic styling.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a frontend with a framework and styling library involves multiple steps. Creating a basic layout can be broken down further for clarity."

			"taskTitle": "User Authentication with JWT",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement JWT authentication middleware' step into subtasks: creating a middleware function, verifying the JWT, handling invalid tokens, and attaching user data to the request.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing user authentication with JWT involves several complex steps, including hashing passwords, generating and validating tokens, and protecting routes."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Handle file size limits and supported formats' step into subtasks: implementing file size validation, validating supported file formats, returning appropriate error messages, and testing the validation logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves interacting with AWS S3, which can be complex. Handling file uploads, including size limits and format validation, requires careful implementation."
		},

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Basic Video Playback",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement the video player with standard controls' step into subtasks: initializing the video player, adding play/pause controls, adding volume controls, and adding a progress bar.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating a video player and implementing basic controls requires several steps to ensure proper functionality."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Background Video Processing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Create a background task in FastAPI to process videos' step into subtasks: defining the background task function, implementing video transcoding logic (placeholder), handling task errors, and logging task progress.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing background processing with Redis and task queues adds complexity. The video processing logic itself can be quite involved."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "User Profile Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement avatar upload and storage' step into subtasks: creating an endpoint for avatar upload, generating presigned URLs for S3, uploading the avatar to S3, and updating the user profile with the avatar URL.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves file uploads and database updates, which can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps."
