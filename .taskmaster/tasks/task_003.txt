# Task ID: 3
# Title: User Authentication with JWT
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user registration and login functionality using JWT for authentication.
# Details:
1. Create user registration endpoint in FastAPI: hash passwords using passlib, store user data in PostgreSQL.
2. Create login endpoint: verify credentials, generate JWT using python-jose.
3. Implement JWT authentication middleware to protect routes.
4. Define User data model in FastAPI using Pydantic.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test user registration with valid and invalid data.
2. Test login with correct and incorrect credentials.
3. Verify JWT tokens are generated and validated correctly.
4. Test protected routes with and without valid JWT.
