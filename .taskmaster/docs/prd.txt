# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
- **Frontend (Svelte)**
  - Single Page Application (SPA)
  - State management with Svelte stores
  - Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
  - Video.js for enhanced playback capabilities

- **Backend (FastAPI)**
  - RESTful API endpoints
  - JWT authentication
  - File handling and streaming
  - Background task processing

- **Storage & Infrastructure**
  - AWS S3 for video storage
  - CloudFront CDN for content delivery
  - PostgreSQL for metadata
  - Redis for caching and background jobs

## Data Models
```typescript
// User
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  hashed_password: string;
  display_name: string;
  avatar_url?: string;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}

// Video
interface Video {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  file_key: string;
  file_size: number;
  duration: number;
  mime_type: string;
  status: 'processing' | 'ready' | 'failed';
  is_public: boolean;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

# Development Roadmap  
## MVP (Phase 1)
1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up FastAPI backend with basic routing
   - Configure Svelte frontend with Vite
   - Implement basic CI/CD pipeline

2. **Authentication**
   - User registration and login
   - JWT token management
   - Protected routes

3. **Video Handling**
   - File upload to S3 with presigned URLs
   - Basic video metadata storage
   - Simple video player

## Phase 2 (Post-MVP)
- User profiles and video management
- Video transcoding for multiple qualities
- Search and filtering
- Basic analytics

## Phase 3 (Enhancements)
- Playlists and collections
- User interactions (likes, comments)
- Advanced video processing (thumbnails, previews)
- Admin dashboard

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation**
   - Backend API structure
   - Authentication system
   - Basic frontend layout

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Video upload flow
   - Video storage and retrieval
   - Basic playback functionality

3. **Enhanced Experience**
   - User profiles
   - Video organization
   - Performance optimizations

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Large File Handling**
  - Implement chunked uploads
  - Set file size limits
  - Use background processing

- **Performance**
  - Implement CDN for video delivery
  - Use efficient video formats
  - Add caching layers

- **Security**
  - Input validation
  - Rate limiting
  - Secure file handling
  - Regular security audits
